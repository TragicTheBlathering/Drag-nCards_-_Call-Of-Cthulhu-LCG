Making of a Fellowship is the introductory adventure in the RPG campaign. The elves Saelirneth and Celemir are exploring the Midgewater Marshes when Celemir is bitten by a strange creature and falls ill.  The young she-elf must seek out the aid of others to find a cure. She encounters the Noldor Faladril and Ranger Cadoran who have the skill and herbs to heal her mentor.  However the key to open the ranger cache has gone missing. Tracking the Hobbit burglar toward Bree the trio find Riv Lightfoot captured by Chetwood Bandits.  Among their ranks is a Rohirrim Outlaw, Athelstan, who has a change of heart and helps to free Riv and fights against their leader Traek.  Now with the key the small fellowship races to collect the herbs Dragon Lily in time before Celemir gives in to the illness or the denizens of the Marshes.

When an enemy with the Swarm trait engages a player that already is engaged with an enemy with the Swarm trait the two enemies combine into one larger foe.  Stack the cards atop one another and add the new cards [threat], [attack], [defense], and hit points together with any other cards in the  Swarm. The end result is one larger foe that has combined stats as well as actions and abilites.  It is treated as one foe for all other purposes and card effects until after it is placed in the discard pile.   Set Up and Celemir: During the set up stage players are instructed to place Celemir in the staging area engaged with the Neeker Breeker Swarm. Both cards are considered in the staging area and contribute [threat] during the quest phase. When the combat phase takes place players deal the Swarm one Shadow card and the Swarm attacks Celemir, and Celemir defends against it. Any Shadow effect that targets a player does not resolve and is discarded from play without effect. Shadow cards that affect the attacker or defender are still resolved. Beware the Swarm may eventually get strong enough to kill Celemir and then the players will lose the game.

Beginning with the first player, each player reveals 1 encounter card and resolves its staging before the next player reveals a card. If an encounter card has an effect that uses the word "you" then the encounter card is referring to the player who revealed the card. If the revealed encounter has the Surge keyword, the player who revealed that card reveals an additional encounter card. Encounter cards with the Doomed X keyword still affecteach player. Burning X: Burning X is a new keyword used in Blood in Breland. When a card with Burning X is revealed from the encounter deck the player that revealed it must choose to either remove progress from the quest stage (but not the active location) or do damage to characters he controls equal to X. If there are no progress tokens on the quest stage the player must do damage to characters he controls instead. Peril: Peril is a new keyword found in The Lord of the Rings Saga Expansion and used here. When a player reveals an encounter card with the Peril keyword, he must resolve the staging of that card on his own without conferring with the other players. The other players cannot take any actions or trigger any responses during the resolution of that card's staging.

Player card effects at one stage cannot affect any other stage. When resolving text on a player card, consider only players at your quest stage as part of the game.

The term "eastmost" thus refers to the stage furthest to the right that is still in play. Each phase of the game is resolved simultaneously, starting with the eastmost quest stage (i.e. 2B fully resolves the combat phase, then 3B, the 4B, then 5B, then 2B resolves the refresh phase, etc.). Within each stage, the phases are resolved in ascending player order.  The Moves West (East) keyword represents cards moving from one stage to another. If a card Moves West (East), it is moved to the nearest staging area that is still in play to the left (right) of its current location, towards (away from) Erebor. Cards at the leftmost (rightmost) stage area are immune to Moves West (East).

Instead, the first player triggers Invade X, where X is the number of players in the game plus 1.  The invade keyword represents the invading forces coming from the east. When the Invade X keyword is triggered, reveal X cards from the encounter deck, one at a time. Any player at any stage can trigger responses (such as Test of Will (CORE 50) or Thalin (CORE 6)) to cards revealed by the Invade keyword.   After resolving any "When Revealed" effects on an encounter card, it is placed in an area depending on its card type: Treacheries are placed in the discard pile, enemies are placed in the eastmost staging area, and locations are placed in the staging area indicated in the bottom-right corner of the card. If the location's staging area is not in play, discard the location without resolving its "When Revealed" effects, and instead deal 2 damage to the eastmost quest stage in play.

The term "quest stage" refers only to the encounter quest cards 2B, 3B, 4B, or 5B, and does not refer to side quests.  There can be an active location at each quest stage, but in order to travel to a location a player must be at that quest stage during the travel phase.
