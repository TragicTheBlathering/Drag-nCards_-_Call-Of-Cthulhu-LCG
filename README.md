<h2 align="center">- a Drag'n'Card's Mod -</h2>
</p>

This is my github for my Drag'n'Cards mod : Call of Cthulhu : The Card Game. 

[Drag'n'Cards](https://dragncards.com/lobby) is a online, web browser based card game virtual desktop designed to run and play the Lord of the Rings LCG. It has recently entered a beta cycle as the developer is expanding the application to allow people to make mods for pretty much any card game they like. For the time being the [beta site](https://beta.dragncards.com/lobby) is the only place you can play the custom usr made plugins.

Your welcome to use it as you like. I have the code for the mod here but not the card data itself, but the code should "fetch" the card data from googleDrive. This is very much work in progress and will be going through a lot of changes... I'm not a programmer but self-taught as I learned modding.. so I get that it is a total mess and could be a real pain for others to read and cause actual pain to people that know what they are doing. Still, it is what it is!

Have Fun and ROLL HIGH<br>
